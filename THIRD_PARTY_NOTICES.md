# Third-party notices

Taikor's original source code is covered by the project's `LICENSE` file.
The build downloads or consumes the separate dependencies below; those
dependencies are not relicensed by Taikor.

## JUCE 8.0.14

JUCE is Copyright (c) Raw Material Software Limited.

Repository: <https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/8.0.14>

A copy of the JUCE licence text is vendored at
[`ThirdParty/JUCE-LICENSE.md`](ThirdParty/JUCE-LICENSE.md) so that it can be
included in every distributed bundle and installer package alongside Taikor's
own licence, as the packaging script does.

License: JUCE framework modules are dual-licensed under the GNU Affero General
Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) and the commercial JUCE licence. Building or
distributing Taikor with JUCE therefore requires either compliance with the
AGPLv3 for the complete combined work or an appropriate commercial JUCE
licence. Review the JUCE 8 licence terms before distribution:
<https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/blob/8.0.14/LICENSE.md>

JUCE includes or interfaces with additional third-party components. Their
copyright notices and licence terms are listed in JUCE's own `LICENSE.md` and
in the JUCE source tree. The VST3 SDK portions used through JUCE are identified
there as MIT-licensed; Apple's Audio Unit frameworks are supplied by the macOS
SDK and remain subject to Apple's terms.

## CLAP support

The CLAP plug-in uses the MIT-licensed `clap-juce-extensions` wrapper, pinned
to commit `c1a5ad025f95d01e03267857fa8276ebeed16500`:

It is Copyright 2019-2020, Paul Walker. The complete upstream licence is
included in [`ThirdParty/CLAP-JUCE-EXTENSIONS-LICENSE.md`](ThirdParty/CLAP-JUCE-EXTENSIONS-LICENSE.md).
